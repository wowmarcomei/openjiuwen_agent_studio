"""Runner pattern for code runner selection based on execution environment.

Strategy pattern: Different execution environments (local, sandbox, wasm, docker, etc.)
are abstracted as different "runners" implementing the same Runner interface.
The calling code only needs to use the interface without caring about underlying execution.

Factory pattern: Based on user configuration (exec_env), dynamically creates
the corresponding runner instance.
